# Coiote Result Transformation
> Take the result from the cloud integration and transform it from "Coiote format" to "Asset Tracker" format. 

Coiote offers 2 options for the cloud integration:
1. AWS
2. Azure 

Both return different data struct on their outputs, for that reason each rase will be cover at the following links:

1. AWS
2. [Azure](https://github.com/MLopezJ/asset-tracker-cloud-coiote-azure-converter-js)
